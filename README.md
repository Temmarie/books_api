# BOOKS API

A RESTFUL API built with Ruby on Rails. Its uses BCrypt and JWT gems to implement Authentication & Authorization. It performs CRUD operations on the various resources it serves.

## About this API

This API is built as the back end for a mobile web application [Geeks Read](https://github.com/Temmarie/Find-Books) built with React on the front end and is separately deployed to Firebase.

## End Points

There are a couple of endpoints exposed by this api and can be accessed online using `http://localhost:3004s/` as the base Url.

### POST Endpoints

- `/users` => Creates a new user on signup.
- `/login` => Signs in an existing user.
- `/favs` => Either creates or destroys the association `Favorites` between the logged_in user and a particular shoe whose id you pass in the request.

### GET Endpoints

- `/books` => Returns JSON of all book in the database.
- `/books/:id` => Returns JSON of a particular book in the database.
- `/favs` => Returns JSON of all shoes associated to the logged_in user through the `Favorite` table in the database.
